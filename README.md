<h1>Hello everyone! ♟☕</h1>
I am very excited to show you the chess system that I developed in the UDEMY - Java COMPLETE Object Oriented Programming course. It was a project where I was able to solidify all the Java content that I had seen during the course up to that point.

The system was made entirely on the concepts of Java OOP:
Constructors,
ToString,
Associations,
Encapsulation / Access Modifiers,
Enumerations,
Inheritance,
Downcasting,
Upcasting,
Static members,
Layers pattern,
Inheritance,
Overloading,
Polymorphism,
Exceptions,
Overriding,
Abstract method, Matrix and List.

Chess is a strategy board game played by two players who take turns moving their sets of pieces to capture the opponent’s King. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s king, that is, to create a situation where it is impossible for the opponent’s king to escape.

In addition to the base game, three special moves were also developed: Castling, En passant, and Promotion.

Castling is a special move in which the king and one of the rooks move simultaneously. The king moves two squares to the side and the rook moves to the square that the king crossed. Castling can be done to the right or left, depending on the chosen rook. Small castling is a move in which the king “rocks” with the rook next to him. En passant capture is a special pawn move, in which the pawn advances two squares, if there is an opponent’s pawn in the adjacent column and in the same row, it can capture the moved pawn as if there had been an advance of only one square to the diagonal. Finally, when a pawn reaches the last square of the opponent, it is promoted and can be exchanged for another piece, such as the queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
